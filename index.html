      <h2 id="P1">Linking up CSS to HTML</h2>
      <p class="tab">
        There are a few ways you can customise the way that your webpage looks.
        Writing the style within the opening tag, adding a style section in the
        &lt;head&gt; tags. The one that I will use moving forward is working
        with a seperate CSS file and linking up that file with the HTML file by
        adding &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"&gt; to the
        &lt;head&gt; tags
      </p>

      <img
        class="center"
        src="/Attachments/P1-image.png"
        alt="some HTML code visible"
        style="width: 500px; height: 80px;"
      />

      <!-- Second Paragraph -->
      <h2 id="P2">Selecting sections</h2>
      <p class="tab">
        When writing CSS you will have to specify what part of the HTML file you
        would like to visually change. You can select different text sections by
        writing down just the attribute and then writing the CSS in curly
        brackets afterwards. <br />
        Using a class (which has to be defined in the opening tag of the HTML
        element) will override all other style elements attached to it. You can
        reference a class by using a period . and then the class name. You can
        add multiple classes to an HTML element by using a space between the
        names
        <br />
        If you just want to select a single element you can use the ID attribute
        within the HTML element. Class can accept multiple values and can be
        used plenty of times, the id can only have one value and be used once
        per page. To reference an ID within CSS you use a hashtag and then the
        ID name
        <br />
        Using a class (which has to be defined in the opening tag of the HTML
        element) will override all other style elements attached to it. You can
        reference a class by using a period . and then the class name. You can
        add multiple classes to an HTML element by using a space between the
        names
      </p>

      <img
        class="center"
        src="/Attachments/P2-image.jpeg"
        alt="some HTML code visible"
        style="width: 500px; height: 300px;"
      />

      <!-- Third Paragraph -->
      <h2 id="P3">All things text</h2>
      <p class="tab">
        But how do you actually change up the text? You can change up the font
        by using font-family, change the size by using font-size and if you want
        to make the text bold you use font-weight! <br />
        You can also change the way the text is aligned by using text-align,
        make everything upper- or lowercase by using text-transform and change
        the spacing by using letter-spacing, word-spacing and line-height.
